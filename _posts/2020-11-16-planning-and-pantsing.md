NaNoWriMo-ers will know of the question "Are you a pantser, or a planner?" Essentially, when it comes to your novel, do you plan it out before you start writing, or do you just go in on the first of November with a vague idea and start typing by the seat of your pants?

Both methods are valid, and people have success both ways around. I have usually been around 90% pantser and 10% planner in the past, and I've never completed a NaNoWriMo. Maybe more planning is needed for future attempts. This particular month of writing blog posts has been about 60:40 in favour of pantsing. I wrote a few topic ideas down in a note over the past couple of months, but otherwise I sit down at my computer with little to no idea about what I'm going to say. 

As a point of interest here at the halfway point, instead of the 25,000 words an on-track NaNo-er will have hit, I'm just over half that at 13,400 across all the posts I've made this month. 

I got to thinking earlier about how the planner/pantser comparison can be applied to more than just NaNoWriMo or similar challenges. In thinking about my approach to life, I feel like I'm a planner in the macro, and a pantser in the micro. I like to know when things such as holidays, gigs, or major events are happening, but am content to work out the minutiae of how all those things are going to work on the fly.

Although over the past two years or so I have felt myself inching closer to the planner side of the equation for everyday life as well. I have long wanted to be able to use a good to-do system, but have found pen and paper to be too slow for that sort of thing (especially the inevitable carrying over of entries from one day to the next). 

Digital systems on the other hand require you to rewire your own way of thinking to how the app itself works (something that I don't think enough designers and developers are cognisant of). This can be equally meddlesome when having to wrestle with the arcane controls of an app-based system instead of just getting shit done.

I've finally landed on [Tick Tick](https://ticktick.com) for an app-based to-do system, and it's been working really well. You can break out tasks into sub-tasks, reschedule entries really easily, set up templates, use recurring reminders to trigger on completion of a task, rather than every so many days, and track habits that you want to build. 

The use of such an app has pushed me more towards being a planner than I ever thought I'd be, although I'm glad to say that the pantsing nature of my writing doesn't seem to have left me. I did not think I'd end up jabbering about a to-do list app in this post, and yet here we are.
