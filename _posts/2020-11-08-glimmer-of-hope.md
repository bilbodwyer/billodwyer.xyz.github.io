I recently experienced what has been described to me as the "death of hope." One evening in the summer it occurred to me that whichever way you slice it, the future looked pretty grim.

In the short term, we had the US elections. Donald Trump was making a lot of noise at the time about not accepting the result no matter what happened, and I half expected the country to break out into some kind of guerilla civil war in the aftermath. Also in the short term is Brexit, and finally leaving the EU. Coupled with the economic buggering that the pandemic has caused the country, the next couple of years could be pretty dicey, if some of the projections about how bad Brexit could be are correct.

Then we slip into the medium term and start to really see climate change begin to bite. 2020 is the coldest year of the next fifty, and increased temperatures are not the only problem we will face. Flooding and extreme storms are projected to become regular occurrences, meanwhile migration crises from areas rendered uninhabitable either by heat or by flooding will be on the rise (and with it presumably a lot more right-wing authoritarianism). 

And the long term doesn't look great either. Once climate change really has its hold over the globe we're likely to see food shortages, resource wars, and even more displacement of people just trying to live their lives. Couple this with the ever-increasing power of large corporations, and the likely outcome looks to be one pretty hellish cyberpunk society.

I was able to vent this to someone I trust earlier this week, which had already started to improve my mood. But then the US election results began to trickle in, and the word was that Trump had lost. There were perhaps millions of votes still to be counted, but things were looking positive. And to cap it all, Trump's complaints of fraud and that the Democrats trying to steal the election seemed to be falling on mostly deaf ears. As far as the bulk of the media is concerned, counting all the votes remains the correct thing to do, and it seems to ensure Biden's victory.

There are still the next two months to get through before Trump can be kicked out of the White House, but it is _unreal_ the relief I feel at the fact we're not going to see another 4 years of Trump's America. Twitter have announced that he's going to lose his privileges as president, and will ban him if he breaks their terms of service (inciting violence, posting misinformation about the election, etc.), and Biden has promised to be a president for all Americans, not just the Democrat voters. After four long years of an insane, populist satsuma being thought of as the leader of the free world, we are returning to a calmer, more measured presidency.

It is my fervent hope that the defeat of Trump starts the clock ticking on right-wing, populist governments and movements everywhere. And even if the world still looks dark and scary in the medium to long terms (climate change hasn't been defeated after all), right now, at the end of this week, hope germinates again, and perhaps isn't as dead as I'd feared.
