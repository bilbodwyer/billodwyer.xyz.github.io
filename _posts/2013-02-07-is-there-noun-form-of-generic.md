I wanted to call this post genericity, but that doesn't even look like a word, much less sound like one. So if anybody knows how to make a noun from the adjective generic, let me know in a comment!  

So it's coming to the end of the first week of February, and I've been a very bad blogger this month.  
Firstly, it's been over a month since my last post, and secondly, my last post was an angry tirade against one of my favourite blogs. For which I apologise.  
It's troublesome finding stuff to write about, as I want to entertain, rather than just have a rant occasionally, or update the Internet at large as to what's new in my life. Because let's face it, of all the people whose blogs you would genuinely love to read, I am not amongst them. (Stephen Fry and Derren Brown instantly spring to mind, but there are likely to be more!)  

Firstly, since it's the start of the month my resolutions update (if you don't know what mine are, have a look at [my blog on that](http://localhost:4000/2013/01/03/resolutions.html)):  
**1.** So far so good, there've been a few close shaves, but I've succeeded in doing my press-ups every day. I'm up to 38 now!  

**2\.** Thus far I've not done tons to look my best, and I do miss the occasional shower. On the whole, I don't think I've totally failed at this. Nor have I fully succeeded either.  

**3\.** I have not been practising Japanese anywhere _near_ as much as I should be doing. And I keep telling myself I'm going to change it, but a lot of it involves being anti-social. Which I don't want to do.  

**4\.** Once again, I've done no work towards this except map out a few ideas in my head (I suppose that actually does count!).  

**5\.** A few years ago I decided I was going to learn how to write computer programs. I stopped very quickly but I'm going to start again soon. With the idea towards having more to talk about or making myself more interesting, programming is probably right up there with watching paint dry or licking windows. So I'll be looking for a few more.  

I don't suppose trying to get 100% of the achievements for the Mass Effect trilogy counts, does it?

Beyond that little update that you all care about so, so much, I really don't have much to talk about... Which is a shame. Because I came at this with such optimism that I'd produce a thoroughly entertaining post! Oh well, there's always next time I suppose...  

Something new that I'm going to try with each of my posts is the following:  
**<u>What I'm Listening To</u>**  
     [All Along the Watchtower - Bear McCreary (Battlestar Galactica Soundtrack)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BigolJfoANw)  
This is a really good version of the song most often wrongly attributed to Jimmie Hendrix - it's a Bob Dylan one folks! McCreary's version is really, really good and I can highly recommend it!  

**<u>What I've Been Watching</u>**  
     House M.D.  
Watching House makes me both a bit happy and a bit sad. Happy because it's a brilliant bit of television and a really good evolution of Sherlock Holmes. A bit sad because it reminds me that at the moment I'm quite far from the path of fulfilling my dream of becoming a doctor. But more on that later!  

Ciao for now!  

PS. If you enjoy my blog, please recommend it to a friend!  

PPS. If you don't enjoy my blog, but read them out of some masochistic self-punishment, recommend it to someone you don't like!  

Toodle pip!
