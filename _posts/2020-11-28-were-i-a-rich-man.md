I enjoy my cooking  
But were I a rich man  
I would pay a fellow  
To buy my food  
Cook, and serve it  

I have fun when driving  
But were I a rich man  
I would hire a chap  
To chauffeur me around  
And look after my car  

I don't mind some housework  
But were I a rich man  
I would find a cleaner  
To tidy up after me  
And do all my laundry  

I actually like budgeting  
But were I a rich man  
I would have an accountant  
To take care of my money  
And see to it bills are paid  

I don't care for my job  
But were I a rich man  
I wouldn't need to work  
And I could spend my time  
Exploring my creative interests  

I have less time than I'd like  
But were I a rich man  
I would have time to spare  
To do what I wanted  
Whenever I liked
