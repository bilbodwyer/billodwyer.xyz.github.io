Do you ever try to work when you're completely tired? When you can feel that fuzziness in your head slowing you down, and making you sluggish. When it pervades your entire body, and your hands don't obey your instructions quite correctly. When it's all you can do to keep your focus and your mind on the task at hand.

That is my state of being today. I tried to do some piano practice after work, and achieved very little with it. And now I'm trying to write something halfway interesting, but coming up null. So today's post is short, sour, and pointless.

I am tired. I couldn't play the piano properly today. I don't have the energy to write something. I can barely fathom how I'm going to cook tonight's meal. A-napping I will go.
