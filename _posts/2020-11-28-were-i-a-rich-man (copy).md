The challenge is almost over, and I'm not too sorry. It's been hard keeping up the creative energy to write, and I find myself putting it off later and later into the day. I enjoy writing, but lockdown has meant that there are fewer things going on for me to be able to write about. I don't really have much to say here today.

I've had a most enjoyable four day weekend, however, and do feel very refreshed. I hope that tomorrow I can face the last day of this writing challenge and write a good retrospective.
