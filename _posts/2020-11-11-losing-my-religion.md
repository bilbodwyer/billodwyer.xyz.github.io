I lost my faith around the age of thirteen, during a school trip to the First World War battlefields in Belgium. Until that point, I had been raised a Catholic - sent to Catholic schools, attending church every Sunday, and recieving a cool new middle name on the 6th day of the 6th month of the 6th year of the new millennium.

My memories of that school trip to Belgium are mostly vague or gone, but in others they remain extraordinarily strong and sharp. A portion of the trench system is kept maintained by way of a museum, and we were able to walk around in it. Seeing fields where the landscape is pitted and hilly from all the artillery fire, now covered over with grass. Lampposts with holes in them for farmers to deposit for dismantling any old shells that they find on their land. Countless white crosses as far as the eye can see. Monument after monument after monument. 

In the city of Ypres there is a memorial called the Menin Gate, which commemorates the British and Commonwealth soldiers who were killed around the Ypres Salient (a specific part of the Western front and the site of numerous significant battles) during World War One. The monument is dedicated in particular to those whose graves are unknown or bodies were never found. Every day at 20:00 since 1928 (apart from a brief few years during the Nazi occupation) the road is closed, and a bugler sounds the [Last Post](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McCDWYgVyps). 

It's a brief but moving ceremony, made all the more so by the 54,000 or so names carved into the stone of the monument. Inside there is a book which lists all of the names on the walls, and a note on where exactly to see that name written down. I even found an O'Dwyer. You can climb to the top of the gate, and look out at the city of Ypres as well.

And it was standing atop the Menin Gate on the last day of the trip that it all just hit me. The sheer amount of death. All the wasted lives. All that violence, suffering, sorrow, pain. Thousands upon thousands of young men, whole towns at a time, were thrown before machine gun fire, made to weather days of constant artillery fire, told to suffocate on deadly, acidic gases. 

Estimates of the death toll for the war _start_ at 15 million. Fifteen million husbands, brothers, sons, uncles, friends. Conscripted into armies whose only plans were to use sheer numbers of bodies to overwhelm the sheer numbers of bullets. Over and over and over again. 

I confess to a particular fascination with the First World War, with the arms race, the violence, the lies. But also with the human stories that came from it: the Christmas truce, the outpouring of poetry and art, stories of trenches full of singing men on both sides. But above all, what hit me on that cold November night when I was thirteen was the utter, undeniable _pointlessness_ of it all. 15 million souls, at least, ripped from life before their time, ultimately for nothing. On that day I rejected the idea of God, or at least any that claimed to be compassionate and to "have a plan." 

I don't regret being raised religious at all. I think it made me overall a more compassionate, tolerant person, and I feel better able to understand those who are motivated by their religion. But for me, I can't possibly believe in a God who would let happen a war such as that which ended 102 years ago today.
