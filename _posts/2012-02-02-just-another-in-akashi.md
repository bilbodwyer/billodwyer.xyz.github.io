So, the long awaited (and what promises to be a rather lengthy) Kobe blog! Though I know what it is you're all really waiting for is the 10 reasons why Japan is better than England (stick with me guys, I'm getting there!)  

**<u>Day 1</u>**  
Shinjuku station is enormous, and unbelievably difficult to navigate at the best of times. But thanks to an alarmingly unhelpful 駅員and an inability on my own account to print a map to the bus terminal, it was down right appalling. Having said that, I was able to find the place thanks to ringing Kester様 and getting the name of the building.  
   The check-in room was freezing, but I survived... Only to be fuming when I discovered that the departure lounge was lovely and heated. Tits!  

Unlike my first ever flight to Japan (back in Year 11... Wow!) the leg room on the coach was _not_ pleasing. Coupled with a rather large bag with all my stuff, less than an hour in I was already numb in the leg...  
   After sporadic sleep, I got to the first of the drop points (Kyoto I think - brought back memories!) and a considerable number of passengers got off... Including all six in the surrounding seats, but not the fellow next to me... Perhaps some innate inability of Japanese to break the rules, he remained in his seat all the way to Osaka where he finally realised that a double seat would allow more space to spread out.  

Arriving in Sannomiya felt very Lord of the Rings-y, when I called Kester to find out where he was waiting and he said "looks towards the sun." After a manly embrace, we got on the train to Akashi and saw the wonderful Akashi bridge and the mountains... Pretty epic views!  
   The drinking began early (after receiving free booze as well as the crate from the sake shop) and we got the beers in and started out with an extraordinary amount of FIFA, 20 minute halves, no less :D  

**<u>Day 2</u>**  
Rising early and hungover, we played one round of FIFA before heading out for some tasty, tasty ramen! It was most amusing to see that Kester was so hungover, he forgot how to speak Japanese (in the process making me feel a little better about myself).  
   The plan for the day was to hit an Irish bar in Akashi - so to pass the time until then, we watched Jurassic Park 2 and made plenty of japes (Don't go into the long grass! You don't have any pokeballs! etc.)  

Hitting Akashi with the Kobe-krowd, we got lost on the way to the pub that Kester _swore_ he knew the way to. Not to worry - some random little Japanese old man asked us if we were lost, and offered directions! When he said he didn't know the place we were headed for, he wandered off... Only to literally _chase_ us down the street to tell us that he'd asked directions and knew where the place was. I love Kansai folks!  

**<u>Day 3</u>**  
Went to collect Kielちゃん from Sannomiya, and hit up Akashi park on the way back... After being three very camera-happy 外人, we all turned out to be far too pussy to ask to take any photos of the cosplayers in the castle's park.  
   The afternoon passed in a bromantic blur and we hit the all you can eat (and drink) meat grilling feast :D After lots of meat and beer (ordering 8 in the last 15 minutes is always a good move) we headed back to Kester's for some Anchorman fun (during which I passed out in the kitchen for a little while).  
   Admittedly, three boxer-clad men sharing a semi-double bed is a little homoerotic, but it's all pure bromance (y)  

**<u>Day 4</u>**  
The day of the marathon... A short trip to the ramen shop for another bowl of delicious ramen to cure Kielちゃん of his hangover and a beer run. And so it begins. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q_zYLIM5_o](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q_zYLIM5_o)  

The rest is a blur of tiredness, alcohol and hangover, but rest assured... It was a hell of a weekend!
