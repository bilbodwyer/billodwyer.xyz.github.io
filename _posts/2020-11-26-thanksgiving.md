As I write the house is filling with the smells of cooking meat, yams, sprouts, gravy, and pumpkin pie. For today is Thanksgiving, an American holiday that I have celebrated for most of the last 10 years, thanks to having an American taking refuge amongst my group of friends. It's normally an excuse to have a lot of people over, eat loads of food, get quite drunk, play games, and be very silly for an evening.

This year is slightly different. Thanks to COVID regulations there will be just four of us in the house eating, rather than the usual twenty or so. After the meal we'll be connecting to a video call with the rest of the group to play some Jackbox or some parlour games. Hopefully it will be just a different kind of fun, but similar amounts thereof. Fingers crossed!

I wanted to write a little about how American culture seems to have seeped into our lives more and more, but today is not a day to be negative and suspicious of a country buying another's blue jeans and listening to their pop music. Today is a day to reflect on what we are thankful for (and thanks to last month's gratitude challenge, I have a lot of practice at this!). I am thankful for lots of things, but the one I am going to pick is my home. I live with three of my closest friends in house that is cosy, well decorated, and conveniently located. I am very grateful for it.
