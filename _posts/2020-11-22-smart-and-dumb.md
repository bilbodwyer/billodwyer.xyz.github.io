Today my housemates and I made an impulsive purchase from Waitrose: four Google Nest Minis, for £19 apiece. For a device that's normally £50, that's one hell of a steal. We've set them up on our rooms, and have had fun communicating with each other by saying "Hey Google, broadcast to Alex's quarters," and passing along some random message.

I've held off on smarthome equipment for ages, for reasons that I may go into another time. Suffice to say, I've been deeply enjoying playing around with the Google Assistant when it's not coming out of my phone. It's an all around nicer experience, I find. I _do_ wish it were possible to set a custom wakeword though. I want to live that Star Trek future where I can say "Computer, play The Mandalorian, on screen." Or even better (and with the addition of some kind of smart, 2020 teasmaid) "Computer, earl grey, hot."

On the opposite end of the tech spectrum, I fixed a dripping tap in my kitchen by replacing the washers. It was a relatively trivial task at the end of it, though one that had filled me with anxiety and dread over getting it wrong. What if I caused a pipe to burst all over the kitchen? But I was able to valve off the water supply, disconnect the tap, replace the washer and give the tap mechanism a good scrubbing, and then replace the whole thing with nary an issue.

Of the two experiences, I'll give you one guess as to which was the more satisfying. Working with one's hands, and seeing the results of a job well done like that is such a great feeling. I'm hoping that I will continue to be able to appreciate a tap that doesn't drip, and one that you no longer have to practically use a wrench to open and close.

In a podcast I used to listen to, there was an episode talking about the concept of [measure](https://aliabdaal.com/podcast/episode-5-why-should-you-invest-in-a-good-kitchen-bin/), a mental model for spending time and money more effectively. The argument goes that it's worth spending more money on something that will bring you joy than less money on the same thing that won't do the same. In this instance, the hosts are talking about spending £100 on a kitchen bin. While I think it's ludicrous to spend that amount of money on something like a bin, I also think that the argument has some merit from a different perspective. 

Small things can build up over time. Little changes in attitude can go a long way. I've already explored how practising gratitude can make you a little happier, overall. The reverse is also true: little annoyances over time build up to become part of a bigger problem. The stories we tell ourselves are narratives formed from little pieces of evidence. The dripping tap forms part of a larger feeling that the whole house is falling to bits. Twenty minutes taken to fix said drip can ripple out and change the overall narrative, and contribute towards a happier state of being.
