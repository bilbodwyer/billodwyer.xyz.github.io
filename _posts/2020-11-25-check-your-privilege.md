I am a straight, white, cis-gendered, middle-class man. I have studied abroad, never gone hungry, always had a roof over my head, never had to hide who I love. I have been lucky time and again throughout my life. In short, I am one privileged guy. 

I don't think I've ever _seriously_ been told to check my privilege, at least not that I remember. In my life's bubble it's more of a thing that happens on leftist Twitter threads and among activist groups at the local student union than in the day to day. But it's a concept that's proved pervasive enough for me to have been exposed to it, and to have seen it happen, and it's that I want to ramble about today. 

Telling someone to check their privilege is a way to call out the advantages that they have over others in every day life, from wealth and health, to race and gender, to religion and level of education. It is often used as a blunt instrument to nullify a person's argument, if that person is perceived as having more advantages in life than another. Put simply, it is a way to tell someone that what they say is not valid, because they have not experienced the struggles of someone who is gay, black, transgender, working class, Muslim, or uneducated.

And to a certain extent, I agree. I don't know what it's like to experience life from those perspectives, and the struggles those people go through on a daily basis as a result of who they are. Perhaps the closest I've come is being picked last for sports in PE, or the very mild racism I experienced in Japan, which I found more amusing and quaint than outright offensive. 

When said in the right way, at the right time, telling someone to check their privilege can be a reminder that perhaps they don't fully understand the thing they're talking about, or that there is a perspective they have not yet considered. You can encourage a positive reaction in another human, to cause them to think that maybe they don't know everything and educate themselves. It can be a good experience all around.

But more often than not, I have seen the privilege check used aggressively, and with intent to shut a person down. It's a form of fallacy which means that unless you have been through and experienced a certain situation, you are not permitted an opinion about it. While not in those exact words, I was once told that I shouldn't feel depressed, because what do I have to be depressed about? Negating a person's feelings because you feel that they are not as valid as your own is deeply selfish and shitty behaviour. It speaks to a lack of empathy, and sometimes a willful ignorance of another person's experience, pain, or situation.

And of course, those arguments are indeed fallacious: of course there are people in the world that feel worse than me. But the same is true for everyone except one single human being. It is not constructive to tell someone that there are people in the world that have it worse. That person already feels bad, and now you're making them feel guilty for feeling bad.

And it is this sort of behaviour that poisons a lot of discourse, souring whole swathes of people against one side or another. Telling white people that they can't support Black Lives Matter, or men that they can't be feminists, or straight folks that they can't engage in transgender discussion... All of that exclusion serves nothing except to silo off your movement, your beliefs, and make them extreme.

Our ideas are made stronger by being discussed, challenged, and re-articulated. Shutting down voices that dissent or disagree, or that speak from a different experience does nothing except to tighten our bubble. We can succeed at very little alone, it is only through alliances and cooperation that we can make real change in the world. We shouldn't tell another human to check their privilege unless it's from a place of empathy, and a desire to help that person empathise better.
