So taking a break from my usual sulky, petty, whining rants about why perfectly good things aren't up to my pathetically high standards; the stress of trying to find gainful employment for when I leave University; and (most importantly) from the final bit of coursework for this semester, I'm going to take the lead from my good friend Liam.  
He's just started his own blog, (over on WordPress, the posh git) and it's good and entertaining... More so than mine, in fact. If you point that mouse of yours up to "Linky Goodness" and look for FallenGeco in that list, I (and I'm sure he) would be very grateful.  

In any event, his most recent blog was a sort of adaptation of a YouTube trend that makes the round every year or so, where vloggers answer a string of questions (comically where possible) and share the video. They then ask their vlogger friends to create a response, and so it spreads.  

Well, I don't do videos, because of the way my face looks:  

**What are you wearing?**  
A sexy black négligée.  

**Ever been in love?**  
Yes. Haytham Kenway was a wonderful man.  

**Ever had a terrible breakup?**  
Turns out he was a Templar. There's just no forgiving that.  

**How tall are you?**  
Like Peter Parker, I hunch.  

**How much do you weigh?**  
Don't tell my mother.  

**Any tattoos?**  
Not as yet. (If you are of a parental persuasion, that's pronounced "I would never!")  

**Any piercings?**  
I used to have my ears pierced, but now I'm relegated to just two piercings. (Again, if you're of a parental persuasion, that's pronounced "I don't really like them, and they'll probably go the same way as my ears")  

**OTP?**  
Urban dictionary tells me that this is _a term used to describe a pair of people that are perfect for each other in fiction_.  
... Robert Frobisher and Rufus Sixsmith. Work that one out.  

**Favourite TV show?**  
Kill La Kill.  
   _DEM OUTFITS!_  

**Favourite bands?**  
This is a LONG list. I'll just advise you to listen to something you won't likely have heard before... Here: [linky linky linky](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)  

**Something you miss?**  
Oat krunchies. Little pillow-shaped oat cereal. Was there anything better?  

**Favourite song?**  
The one that currently has the most plays in my library is Roll the Woodpile Down.  
Side note to my family: bet you never saw that coming, did you?  

**How old are you?**  
Raef is ten years older than Émile. Brian was born eighteen months after Émile. If Brian was born in 1992, how old - _balls._  

**Zodiac sign?**  
Leo, in the year of the monkey.  
Rwar.  

**What do you look for in a partner?**  
I work well both in a team and on my own. Oh, you don't mean in the workplace?  

**Favourite quote?**  
"A small pie is soon eaten"  
   \- Alan Davies  

**Favourite actor?**  
Alex Leece.  

**Favourite colour?**  
I once did a personality test in which we were asked to name two things that have the colour of our favourite colour. Only afterwards did they tell us that the words we said define our characters...  
_Fire and blood._  

**Loud music or soft?**  
If other people can't hear it, what's the point in earphones?  

**Where do you go when you're sad?**  
Middle earth, via Westeros. Usually travelling by TARDIS.  

**How long does it take you to shower?**  
Longer and longer whilst the bathroom gets colder and colder.  

**How long do you take to get ready of a morning?**  
Morning? What's that?  

**Ever been in a fight?**  
Probably. For some reason I come across as a little annoying.  

**What do you find attractive? (Reworded for a PG audience)**  
Violinists.  

**What do you find unattractive?**  
Old violinists.  

**Fears?**  
I laugh in the face of fear!  

**What was the last thing that made you cry?**  
Maia standing on my testes.  

**The last time you said you loved someone?**  
I probably said it a lot on Sunday. I was very drunk.  

**Meaning behind you username?**  
Bill is the short form of William, coming from the German _Wilhelm_ meaning _determined protector,_ and O'Dwyer is an Irish surname meaning _of dark hair._ The Internet doesn't like the apostrophe, but I think it looks refined.  

**The last book you read?**  
The Very Hungry Caterpillar in Japanese.  

**The book you're currently reading?**  
Jurassic Park... Clever girl.  

**Last TV show you watched?**  
Franklin & Bash  

**The last person you spoke to?**  
My housemate/husband.  

**The relationship between you and the last person you sent a text to?**  
He's my favourite actor.  

**Your favourite food?**  
Lion bars. And if I run out of lion bars... I'll speak to the people that make lion bars, and get more lion bars.  
RWAR.  

**A place you want to visit?**  
Space.  

**The last place you were?**  
Look, I get that you're just an Internet quiz, but this doesn't make any sense. Standing next to my desk chair before sitting upon it?  

**Do you have a crush?**  
So help me, if Viggo Mortensen ever finds out, I'll be really embarrassed.  

**Last time you kissed someone?**  
Like I say, I was really drunk on Sunday.  

**Last time you were insulted?**  
Taking this quiz. It's pretty invasive.  

**Favourite flavour of sweetie?**  
I've already said: lion bars. Lion bar flavour.  

**What instruments do you play?**  
All of them. Not very well. In some cases pretty damned shitly, to be honest. But all of them.  

**Your favourite piece of jewellery? **  
My watch. It's the only thing strangers ever seem to compliment about me. Other than my négligée, that is.  

**The last sport you played?**  
Train-catching. Try it. Assume you're going to make a connection at any British railway station.  

**Last song you sang?**  
Star of the County Down. Another shocker for the family there. I bet you think I've grown out of all that ridiculous metal, don't you? I can tell, you know.  

**Favourite chat up line?**  
"Excuse me, but you owe me a drink. You see, I saw you and dropped my first one."  

**Have you ever used it?**  
All the time. I get all the girls, I get all the girls.  

**When did you last hang out with someone?**  
Minus forty minutes ago.  

Well, that was fun, wasn't it? I bet you all feel so much better for knowing that about me.
