Every great poet and writer, every subtle politician and marketer, every experienced teacher and preacher all know that there is great power in words. We attach such _meaning_ to words, such history, such feeling. There are English words today that it is no longer acceptable to say, because of their meaning or historical associations.

The words we use daily shape our minds and our feelings. Simple words like _can't_ or _shouldn't_ limit us, and keep us firmly within our comfort zone. Negative reinforcement is a powerful tool, and if we aren't careful we can slip into feeling powerless, talentless, and worthless.

Repetition is the key to any habit, and repeating to ourselves that we _can't_ juggle, sing, or do a lay-up will eventually lodge itself into our brains to the point that we don't even want to try. [You _can_ learn to  juggle](https://www.thejugglingscientist.com/learn-to-juggle.html). [You _can_ learn to sing](https://thevocaliststudio.com/can-anyone-learn-to-sing/). [You _can_ learn to do a layup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5cEf6N-qfE). These are all things that take patience, practice, and persistence, and telling yourself _I can't_ too much is the quickest route to never even trying.

This isn't a particularly astute observation, dear reader. You will, I'm sure, be already well aware of the power you have over your own mind in the choice of words you use. It's popular psychology at its finest, and it's the tweetable version of a whole bunch of self-help books: using positive words will make you a positive person.

The reason I bring this up today is because it was recently (well, not recently, but "several months ago, and I noted it down to remember to blog about it" isn't quite as snappy) commented on that I was saying _life-work balance_, instead of the more common _work-life balance_.

This fleeting bit of phrase flippery was a deliberate choice on my part, in fact. Words have power, and to some extent, I believe that the order we use words in has power as well. Well-practised speakers have many tricks, tips, and other tools in their arsenal to get their point across ([this](https://youtu.be/_aFo_BV-UzI) is a great video outlining how Donald Trump's particular way of answering a question works), and to make you think or feel a certain way. The rule of three is one that you may already be familiar with.

But back to life-work balance. It even feels unusual to say, right? Try it out loud now, and then try work-life balance. One feels more natural than the other, and I bet it's the latter. There are two reasons I chose to say it this way. It is worth noting at the outside that I distinguish work on hobbies and projects such as my music to be very different from work at a job. It's this latter form that I mean from here on out.

The first reason for my choice of an unnatural word order for this phrase is that it forces me to be deliberate about its use, and thus makes me think deliberately about balancing life and work. Instead of letting myself see what others do and trying to match their own efforts and levels of input, I am trying to train myself to find the level of input that suits _me_. Learning to think regularly about the impact that work is having on my life (and vice versa) helps me to keep tweaking my attitude, and to regulate how much input work should receive. 

The second -- and in my view most important -- reason being that my way, life comes first, and not work. You may have heard someone tell you that you should work to live, and not the other way around. This is my extension of that. Balance must be struck, yes, but life should always come first. By reordering the words, I reinforce to myself that work is not the sole purpose of life, and also that (at least for me) life is the sole purpose of work. I remind myself that I shouldn't be sacrificing too much of _me_ for work. 

Words have power. The order we assign them matters. Being deliberate about their use is a powerful tool in one's arsenal for not being ruled and limited by the language we speak.
