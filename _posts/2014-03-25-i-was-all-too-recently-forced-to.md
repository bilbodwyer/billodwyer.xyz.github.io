I was all too recently forced to survive for 36 hours without a stable Internet connection.  
I know. Brutal, right?  

It's the first-worldiest of first world problems, but that's a rant for another day. Today's blog will be a ramble in two parts.  

**_Part the First: Addict_**  
It was early afternoon on Saturday the 22nd March 2014, and the Internet suddenly gave up the ghost. We were without a connection. Oh, our phones displayed that glorious Wi-Fi signal symbol, but connect we could not. Forced to resort to conversation and casual gaming to stave off the inevitable end of all things, but no online interaction for us.  
The hours ticked by, still no fix. Using paltry signal on a mobile Internet connection, we checked the status of Virgin broadband in the area and found it to be a problem throughout the area. The estimated fix time was midday on Sunday. We could survive. After all, we had company in the evening that could distract us from our disconnecty woes.  
Sunday morning occurred in a bleary mess and still no Internet. The router is turned off, and the house is vacated in favour of the local greasy spoon. The router is turned back on upon return, and still nothing. It's after midday, and we had hoped it would be fixed by now. The Virgin team now say a fix should be available by the following day.  
Resorting to cleaning the house before attempting to entertain ourselves without the use of the Internet, we make it to Monday, and University. What a blessing to have something with which to distract ourselves from the woes of disconnection. After returning home, in a final desperate attempt before demanding an engineer cure us of this disease-like state, I jiggle all of the wires and restart the router once more.  

_O! The blinking light!_  
_The flickering blue star_  
_That signals the return of_  
_the book of faces_  
_the endless video_  
_the electronic mail_  
_eldritch rants and o!_  
_the status updates_  
_link sharing and_  
_communication_  
_Thank you, blue star_  
_For leading us to our destination_  

Or something less tortured and marginally more subtle.  

I wrote a blog almost a year ago on the subject of being [addicted to my smartphone](http://localhost:4000/2013/05/19/addicted.html) and this experience threw into harsh relief the freedom that actually comes from not being connected to the Internet. Yes, it is embarrassing how many times I crossed my fingers and hoped that _this time_ would be the time for the router to start working after a reboot. But in between those times, it is amazing how little I cared for the missing Internet.  

**_Part the Second: Status_**  
Not the type of status update that Facebook quietly, but incessantly asks us for at all times. But what comes from having the very best of possessions.  
It is common knowledge that I don't use Windows or Mac because I don't believe in paying for operating systems and I am quite happy using Linux thank you very much. Anybody that wants to can read about that particular little tantrum [here](http://localhost:4000/2013/11/12/why-i-hate-windows-7.html) or just ask me about computers and watch in amusement as I explode with rage that everybody thinks that Windows is the only option ***ahem*** I'm back, sorry.  

Today I was walking through the Leeds Student Union, happily eating my English breakfast pasty and getting crumbs everywhere. My jubilation at finally filling my stomach was torn to pieces by an overheard conversation by two people of the female type sitting at a table with their laptops out. Their laptops were Apple Macs, and I'm guessing on the newer side - they were very thin, shiny, metallic... and expensive looking. Take a look on the [Apple website](http://www.apple.com/uk/macbook-air/) and notice that their cheapest offering in the laptop department; £849.  
Now, this is not a tantrum about how awful Macs are, or that they are overpriced, or evangelism about why people shouldn't use the operating system. I have a lot of respect for the ecosystem, and a lot of good things have come from Apple in the past decade or so.  

My issue is what I heard one of these girls saying to her friend:  

_"Oh, I only really use my computer for the Internet."_  
Fantastic. You've just spent the best part of one thousand pounds to buy one of the best computers available today and only use it to check Facebook and your emails. So why do you own it? Would not a cheaper computer have suited? Google make their Internet-dedicated chromebooks, why not get one of those? It would have cost you a quarter of the price and you could have spent the remaining _£600_ on something like driving lessons. Or a holiday.  
I'm the last person to teach about being sensible with money. My idea of good business practise can't actually be written here in case a prospective employer reads this and sees that not only am I a raving lunatic but also have literally no idea how the economy works. Suffice it to say that I think right now the best place to invest in is Russia. Or Crimea.  

What it eventually comes down to, surely, is that a Mac is a status symbol? People of my generation are familiar enough with computers and technology for the "it just works" argument to be so much dung. Maybe I just don't get it. But I'll give you another example of my startlingly acute business acumen: If I were in charge of selling Apple computers, I would require each customer to submit a usage plan for their new machine that they must stick to or else. That'll see 'em right.
