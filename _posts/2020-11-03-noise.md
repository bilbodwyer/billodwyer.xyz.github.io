Amongst my friends, we have all at one point or another said of the beginning of the first national lockdown in the UK that it was so very _quiet_. My home during the first lockdown was close to a portion of the Leeds city loop, a section of road that is rarely calm, and the traffic noise from that road was easily audible from the back yard, or through my open window. But during the first weeks of the national quarantine, traffic petered out to a bare minimum, and even pedestrians seemed less inclined to leave their homes. Coupled with the start of a particularly clement spring made the first lockdown a very relaxing experience in some ways. It took me a few weeks to notice exactly why I felt so relaxed, but there was a moment when sitting at my desk working, the window thrown wide open, all I could hear of the world outside was birdsong. Not the thrum of an engine, or the chatter of a neighbour on the phone. Nothing but nature in one of its most musical forms. The singing was often so loud that people I spoke with on the phone commented on it.

During a government-sanctioned walk, I took myself around the city centre, and was amazed to find it almost deserted. It was a striking moment of peace and quiet. The usual cacophony of bus engines, road works, and a thousand half-heard conversations -- sounds which I would normally resort to blasting music through my headphones to cover -- were gone, and with it the need to try and mask them. So addictive was that sense of peace that I tried a second time to experience it, only to be thwarted by a slight easing to the restrictions across the country.

This has led me to a particular fascination with the concept of noise. According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise), noise is unwanted sound considered unpleasant, loud or disruptive to hearing. From a physics standpoint, noise is indistinguishable from sound, as both are vibrations through a medium, such as air or water. The difference arises when the brain receives and perceives a sound. The concept of noise, then, is one of perception and subjectivity. One person's third symphony is another's pneumatic drill. Small wonder, then, that the near-constant presence of noise can lead to [adverse health effects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3988259/) including stress, hypertension, fatigue, and cognitive impairment. Multiple studies have shown that students in classrooms near train tracks, exposed to the regular sound of passing trains, perform more poorly than their peers on the other side of the school building, more shielded from the noise.

Something I'm sure anyone can attest to is the surprise when a sudden, familiar noise goes away. "I say old chum," the conversation likely goes, "I dare say I didn't quite realise just how jolly loud that air conditioning unit is until I noticed it wasn't on just now, what." It's something I've certainly experienced at work: the air conditioning unit switches off at 18:00, and I was frequently there to notice it. Except I hadn't been noticing it at all, until it had gone away. We are also, I hope, intimately aware of how too much sound can be harmful. Loud workplaces are required to provide ear protectors to prevent permanent hearing loss, and we are advised to wear earplugs at loud concerts, or else pay the price of the incessant ringing of the ears as we try to sleep afterwards. 

And yet noise pollution continues to rise across the urban world. Cars are engineered to be quieter, yes, but there are more on the road than ever. Few cities are far enough from airports to not be disrupted by the sounds of aircraft landing or taking off. More people crowd into cities each year, and the [United Nations estimates](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/17/two-thirds-of-world-population-will-live-in-cities-by-2050-says-un) that by 2050 two thirds of the population will live in cities. We don't notice the familiar ambient sounds of urban living until they are ripped away from us, like they were at the start of this year. But with their loss we regain sounder sleep, lower levels of stress, and improved cognitive ability. And as the world returns by degrees to normality, we are once again subjected to the stress of constant noise.

A concept you may be familiar with is that of decision fatigue: one's ability to make choices deteriorates throughout the day, as we expend mental energy on each. Why should tuning out ambient noise be any different? Perhaps the reason that so many feel so drained after a week in the office is not because of the mental labour of _work_ but because of the unconscious labour of tuning out background noise? Maybe you too have felt that since the initial peace of quarantine (if you were lucky enough to experience it. I concede that many were not), your stress has increased as the outside world returns to its usual, noisy state. I can tell you that I have. The high-pitched whine of a laptop fan, transmitted by video chat from a colleague's computer to my bedroom for 8 hours a day has become close to unbearable. 

Noise cancelling ear- and headphones are becoming more ubiquitous than ever before, and it is not difficult to understand why. Some days it's nice not to have to hear anything at all.
