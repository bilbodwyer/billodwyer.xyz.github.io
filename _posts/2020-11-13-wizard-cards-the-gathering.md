Magic: The Gathering (or 'Wizard Cards' for the uninitiated) is a fantasy card game developed by Wizards of the Coast, the same company that brings you Dungeons and Dragons. And it's absolutely amazing.

I'm a huge fan of tabletop RPGs, card games, and board games, so it seemed only natural that I would enjoy Wizard Cards as well. My girlfriend and I play a lot of board games together, but since I made a gift of the five starter packs to her in October, Wizard Cards has consumed all of our game playing ever since. It's an addictively fun game; rounds are quick, turns escalate quickly, and there's a constant, satisfying "just one more go" churn to the whole thing.

The objective of the game is to reduce your opponents health points from 20 to 0. The game has five different colours of magic cards with which to achieve this: red, black, blue, green, and white. Each colour plays slightly differently. Red causes a lot of direct damage, blue is about drawing loads of extra cards, and white is about powering up all of your creatures. You do this by playing lands cards which increase the amount of mana points you have available to cast each spell, and summoning creatures to defend yourself from your opponents attacks.

I don't feel particularly competent at the game. My girlfriend has roundly beaten me in about 80% of the games we've played, but each time I've learned a little more strategy and a little more about the game. And even when losing, I don't feel like I'm having a bad time playing the game. It's so much fun trying to cobble together a strategy each time from the cards you draw, and watching her do the same thing.

Another aspect of the game is the trading card aspect. Wizards of the Coast are constantly developing and releasing new cards for the game, refreshing the "core" set of cards every year. Your Cards: the Wizarding deck is in a constant state of change, tweaking it to optimise for more mana, or cards you can use to heal, or more direct damage to your opponent. To me right now the game feels like a limitless library of potential and possibility, just waiting for me to pick up the right combination of books.

The archivist in me is also really enjoying the game. We spent a couple of weeks working on a spreadsheet of all the cards we have, and the games that we've played, and the decks that we run. It's been a surprisingly fun experience, and I hope to grow it into something more powerful than just a spreadsheet, and make it useful for building decks as well as keeping records of them.

Towards the end of October, my girlfriend and I bought ten booster packs, which are little packs of 15 random cards. Using these we played a "booster draft," where we opened a pack, chose a card, swapped hands, and repeated. Doing this we each built up a collection of 75 cards, and then used those to create 60 card decks (adding mana we already had). These hasty bodges were fantastic fun to play, and slowed the game down in a satisfying way as we got to grips with our new decks.

My decks have tended to focus more towards the black, red, and blue cards. I like the combination of extra draw, direct damage, and powerful creature effects these colours give me, and they seem to match well against my girlfriend's preference for the white and green cards. It is a happy accident that we have covered all five colours in those choices!

Some games can be excellent, and others are extremely frustrating. I had a game where I was only able to play three mana and then stuck with a hand full of more expensive cards that I just couldn't use. Or when the opposite happens, and one of us spends five or six consecutive turns just drawing mana. I can feel myself turning towards the idea of house rules to work around these sorts of issues, because those games are never fun. On the other hand, it was a run of mana like this that led to my first proper win at the game, in which I amassed a field of incredibly strong creatures and managed to reduce my girlfriend's health to more than 18 below zero.

Magic: the Cardsening, then, is probably my happiest discovery in board gaming this year. It seems like it is more than a game, it is a hobby within a hobby. Coming across it reminds me of the feeling I had when I first discovered that board games were so much more than just Monopoly, Chess, or Cluedo. It's exciting to have set out on that voyage again.
