The BBC adaptation of Philip Pullman's extraordinary trilogy packs one hell of a theme tune. It has long been a view held amongst my friends that in order to compete against the HBOs, Netflixes, and Amazon Primes of the world, the BBC need to start upping their game dramatically. Whether or not they have done that for [His Dark Materials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JAZKy8BpA) remains to be seen, but in one respect they have completely outclassed the competition. The opening theme to the show is extraordinarily good, to say nothing of the fabulous animation that accompanies it.  

From the very first episode, I knew that I wanted to cover the opening theme. I could hear it, clear as crystal and fully formed inside my head as I walked home. And it is that cover which I present to you below. It's been a long time in the works, and has involved overcoming no small amount of [imposter syndrome]({% post_url 2020-10-02-imposter-syndrome %}), procrastination, and a particularly steep learning curve.
