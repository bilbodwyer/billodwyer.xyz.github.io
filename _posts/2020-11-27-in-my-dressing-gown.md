The sky is clear  
except for some  
soft grey clouds  
beyond the hill  

The early setting sun shines orange  
on the woods  
and the houses  
that sit atop the ridge  

Not a single bird crosses  
the pale blue sky  
though I can hear  
their chorus  
and a gentle wind blows  
cold  
on my face  

I can smell the traffic  
from the road behind my house  
mingling with  
the earthy smell of trees  
from the field in front  

Neither my hot black coffee  
nor my dressing gown  
are enough  
to keep the  
cold  
at bay  
on this  
the first truly frosty day  
of the year
