Today, dear reader, I shall be a hypocrite. Spotify is an incredibly convenient, cheap, and copacetic service, one which I use almost daily. As a user of the app, I am one of over [280 million](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/spotify-statistics/) satisfied customers. As an artist, [Sir Curse](https://sircurse.com) have 2 out of an estimated 35 million songs on the service, and we are also generally quite satisfied with Spotify.

As you can see, just in the last 28 days Sir Curse are able to boast listeners in the USA, Russia, Canada, Thailand, and Peru. We have been able to reach locations that would have been unimaginable for a small artist twenty years ago. Not only that, but we are able to collect some demographic information about our listeners, including their age and gender, in addition to their location. For example, I can tell you that our music seems to be most popular with people identifying as male, between the ages of 23-27. 

[Tarot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzrrG3btZv0), our single released in 2019 has received just over 3,000 listens since its release, almost two years ago. [Graphite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDeQZM71TXU), released earlier this year, has about half that number. 4,500 streams of music that I helped to write, record, and perform. That's quite amazing when I think about it, and I am incredibly grateful to be able to have listeners and fans the world over thanks to this service.

*However*. All is not rosy with Spotify, particularly as an artist. According to distrokid, (the service we use to upload music to online services) the two singles release by Sir Curse in the last two years combined have earned $50.73, which by today's exchange rate is somewhere around £38. Not bad right? But when breaking down by service, we find that Spotify is responsible for not even half of the total earnings for both singles, coming to $18.60 or about £14:

Now, I should say that I don't expect to be able to earn a living through playing in Sir Curse for a very long time, if ever. We are a niche 6-piece band in a heavily saturated market, and to be able to earn any money at all is gratifying. However, dividing our $18.60 by the 4,500 streams gives us a grand total of 0.4 cents (ish) per stream. Or put another way, we need to have around 250 streams across both songs to earn a single dollar. Which is [exactly what everyone else seems to get](https://junkee.com/justice-spotify-stream-demands-artist-petition/276139) as well, so at least we're not getting dicked on that front I suppose.

Let's do a little more maths, shall we? In the olden days before music streaming really took off, say around ten years ago, people still bought music through the iTunes store. Single songs were usually priced around £0.99, and albums were priced as a discounted way of buying all the songs it contained, for example £2.99 for a 4-track EP.

Returning to those 4,500 streams, let's be stingy and say that 5% of that number represent unique listeners that would be willing to actually buy the songs: 225, or a similar amount in actual real sterling. That's enough to cover band weekly band practice for nearly two months. That would go towards half of what it cost to record, mix, and master the tracks in the first place. That money could put a serious dent in the costs of petrol and accommodation to make touring to promote our music more attractive and possible. 

But that's not the world we live in now. Music is a commodity, to be chucked on without thinking about it. "Alexa, play a workout playlist." "Hey Google, put on some gypsy jazz." "Hey Siri, I want to listen a heavy metal mix." Spotify and services like it build complex algorithms to try to generate playlists that seem both random and suited to your tastes. And I'll be the first to admit that some of these services are _very_ good at this. I was blown away by Spotify's automatic playlists compared to [Google's.](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-music-transfer-google-play-music-library)

Music has become what Freddie begged it not to: [background noise.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azdwsXLmrHE) And as artists, there's little we can do. We have to go where the listeners are, and they are on Spotify because it's convenient, it's easy, it's cheap, and it works. I'm on Spotify too, for exactly the same reasons (I told you I'd be a hypocrite). We don't go to music shops any more, and we don't spend any time browsing iTunes for new releases. Why bother, when you can have all the world's music available for £9.99 a month? 

Why? Because artists deserve better. Small, independent artists who are already struggling to get into a punishing and fickle industry are being throttled by streaming services. Some estimates put the number of songs being uploaded to Spotify every day at 40,000. Forty thousand. That's more than a quarter of a million in a week, or 14 million per year. How can [Sir Curse](https://sircurse.com), [The Harriets](https://www.theharrietsband.com/), [Tranqua Lite](http://tranqualite.co.uk/), [Teeff](https://teeff.bandcamp.com/), [Petrichor](http://www.petrichordoom.co.uk/), [Pulverise](https://pulveriseuk.bandcamp.com/), or any of the other countless bands working in the Yorkshire music scene compete with that? £14 for two years' worth of listens? That's bullshit.

But Spotify have offered to redress this balance. In exchange for [reducing the fee you receive](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/03/spotify-artists-promote-music-exchange-cut-royalty-rates-payola-algorithm), you can reach even more listeners! The promise of **exposure** that promoters use to get out of paying bands for live shows has finally penetrated the streaming world. What utter shit.

I have other reasons for disliking Spotify as well, but I won't go into them here. What I am saying is that for small, independent artists, Spotify is anathema to financial success, or even stability. By only listening to music only via streaming services (not just Spotify mind, they are just the particular target of my ire today), we as consumers deprive the artists of tomorrow the opportunity to get properly paid for the valuable work they do today. 

So what can you do to redress this imbalance, you ask? Pay for music, I answer!  How many times have you listened to a new album a handful of times, enjoyed it, and then put it away again? I know I do this all the time. So a final bit of maths for you. Let's say your favourite band on the local scene has just released a brand new, ten track album, and you listen to it ten times all the way through over the course of a few weeks. If you'd done that via Spotify, you've just given them 100 streams, or somewhere in the region of $0.40. However, if you'd _purchased_ the album from a website such as [Bandcamp](https://bill-odwyer.bandcamp.com/releases) for even half of the cost of your monthly Spotify subscription, the band receives closer to _ten times_ the amount they earn through Spotify. If one hundred people do the same as you, that band have already received enough of a sum to begin covering their recording costs. That feels more like it, no?

Look. Streaming is great. You and I both know that. It's easy to use, it's got a huge library of music, and you if you can stand the adverts you can even listen for free! But next time you see a busker out on the street with a CD to sell, or the next time you hear that a band has just released a new album, or if you're at a gig and you spy the merch table. Do the music scene a favour, and give them your money. They'll be a whole lot more grateful than Spotify will, and you may just have helped give a leg up to the next Johnny Cash, Queen, or Beatles.
