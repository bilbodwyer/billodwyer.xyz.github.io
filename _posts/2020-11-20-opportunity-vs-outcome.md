Human perception is a funny thing. Did you know that Spotify had to [make their shuffles _less_ random](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2014/02/28/how-to-shuffle-songs/) so that they would _seem_ more random to human ears? The TL;DR of that link is that truly random systems will spit out patterns all the time, because that's just probability. If you toss a coin enough times, you will eventually see ten tails in a row. And yet what we expect to see colours how we experience things all the time.

Our own understanding of something as simple as words can have huge implications for how we communicate with each other. What we mean when we say random is not the same as what a computer programmer hears when she hears the word. Which brings me to what I'd like to actually talk about today: equality, and two subtypes thereof: opportunity and outcome.

### Opportunity
Equality of opportunity is the idea that the rules of the game are level, and thus everybody has the same chance to acrue wealth, prestige, and success. This is the situation that everyone should be able to _apply_ for the job, and that the position is filled by the most qualified person for the role. It is the foundational tenet of a meritocracy.

### Outcome
Equality of outcome on the other hand is the idea that no matter the rules of the game, the end state should be the same for all players; everyone ends up with an equal share of wealth, prestige, and success. This is the situation in which the job role is filled by a person that fits a certain demographic to better represent the overall cohort of society. This is often associated with Marxist and communist ideologies, but the discussion of the haves and have-nots goes back as far as Aristotle. 

As you may have spotted, belief in one of these different sides of the equality coin often lies with one's political views. Those that lean right are more likely to believe in equality of opportunity, and those on the left believe more in equality of outcome. Of course there exist right-wingers who believe in outcome, and leftists who believe in opportunity as well. I am one such leftist. 

If you were to tell me that equality of outcome is unfair, because it punishes the capable and rewards others for things out of their control such as race, age, gender, or wealth, then I would agree with you. But I would also counter that opportunity while laudable is inherently unfair. There are many millions who are born without the same opportunities as those born into wealth, health, and power.

As [Julian Glover put it](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/oct/10/left-equality-fair-society-rightwing), we need to "understand the impossibility and undesirabilitiy of equality [of outcome]," and also to "realise that a divided and hierarchical soceity cannot be fair."

I would argue that proper equality of opportunity is the optimal scenario, but that we will likely be striving to achieve it for as long as capitalism continues to exist. Working towards that is a noble goal however, but I think in the short term we need to accept that there are a couple of potentially _un_fair things that we need to do to achieve it.

First, whether we like it or not, is equality of outcome. We need in the short term to show people (particularly those in minorities) that they are able to perform the jobs that are currently dominated by the majority. To use my favourite example, if a young Asian lad aspires to be a footballer for a major club, but only ever sees white men playing for his favourite team, that can and will affect his perception of whether or not he is suited to that career. In the same way that we don't truly random shuffles as properly random, he may see a pattern that (while not necessarily true) shows he is not allowed to be a footballer, whether capable or not.

And so we need to hire for diversity and representation. If our young lad sees that people of his race are successful footballers, businessmen, lawyers, doctors, or whatever, then that breaks down an invisible wall that he himself has raised. By making diverse, representative, and equal the cohort of workers in "successful" positions, we can show aspiring young men and women that they can achieve whatever they want, regardless of their class, race, or gender.

For the second thing we need to do, let's learn about a new form of equality: equality of condition. 

### Condition

Imagine you're playing a game of monopoly with three other people. Two of the players start off with hotels and houses already on the board, and with £5000 of capital to their names already. You and the other player start off £5000 in debt. From the perspective of equality of condition, you can argue that the game is rigged, and though all four of you have the _opportunity_ to win (thanks to lucky dice rolls and savvy investments), the game is heavily rigged in favour of the wealthy players. 

We need to readjust the rules of the game to allow for those players that start £10,000 and several properties behind to catch up without sacrificing everything they have. We cannot truly have equal opportunities if the playing field is so un-level that it's a wall. 

If we can redistribute wealth to those in greater need, and put up with unfair hiring policies in prestigious positions for perhaps a generation, then we can get a long way towards the dream of true equality of outcome. Equality of opportunity is the desirable end-state, but to get there we need to act with different goals in mind.

Just as people's perception of randomness led the developers at Spotify to amend their algorithms, we need to be conscious and aware of what people mean when they say equality. For some it means an equitable number of men and women in managerial positions across government and the private sector, being paid the same for the same work. For others it means interviewing all the best candidates for the job, regardless of their backgrounds, and hiring the best one(s). When we talk to others about equality (as with anything) we should be sure to be reading from the same hymn book as the other person. Definitions are important, and if your definition of a term differs from mine before we start debating, then we're not going to get anywhere. You may have noted this when listen to political debates about any number of things. Poverty, for example, is being defined differently by the two main UK parties at the moment, which allows both to shriek statistics at the other side, without anyone being incorrect.

So ultimately, before we can start on any of this, before we can redistribute the wealth, before we can force unequal hiring practices on the world, we need to sit down and have a conversation about what we _mean_ by equality first.
