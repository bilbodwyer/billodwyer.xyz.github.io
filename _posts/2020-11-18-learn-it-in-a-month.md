We've all seen those adverts, right? Learn to play the guitar in a month! In just 14 days you can learn to code! Cook like Gordon Ramsey in four weeks! At the beginning of the year when the pandemic really hit it seems as though a glut of these sorts of "deals" popped up across social media, and the Internet as a whole.

When lockdowns and furlough began to really hit, there seemed to be a large cultural pressure to _make the most_ of your lockdown. Pick up a new skill, study for a change in career, throw yourself into a hobby. There was a glut of articles in the news, across social media, and even on my work's intranet about making the most of all the extra time. 

It's nothing new or unique to 2020. [This article](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work) is a good read on the situation that millennials currently face: venture capital, the continued fallout from the 2008 financial crisis, the decline of the middle class and the rise of the 1%, and the steady decay of unions and stable, full-time employment. But it also details an interesting phenomenon amongst my generation: the constant optimisation and need for efficiency.

There is an expectation to always be hustling towards the next side project. You should always have something else on the go to be earning more money, to be improving yourself, to be making yourself more appealing to the next employer. There are too many causes for this situation than I feel prepared to unpack here, but it's something that I feel, and many of my friends do as well. A to-do list (whether in the form of an app or a [bullet journal](https://bulletjournal.com/)) is a near essential for many of us. We drink [Huel](https://uk.huel.com/) because it's the most efficient way of "eating" a nutritious meal. We wear yoga pants because it saves time spent getting changed before a workout. Self-care is no longer about giving yourself a break, it's about self-optimisation.

We're experiencing a time crunch, wanting to learn and do things in ever smaller periods of time, because we need as much extra time as we can get. Adverts from companies telling you that you can become fluent in sign language in just one month are capitalising on this situation: you don't have the time to spend a year learning a language, you don't have [10,000 hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)) to put into mastering photography, you can't wait four years to become an expert in web design.

If not a lie, then we are being sold a mis-truth. With dedication and daily practice, you can certainly learn the basics of coding, playing the guitar, cookery, photography, a language, or anything else in a short space of time like 4 weeks. But you are not going to gain mastery, because that takes time, discipline, and practice. What you _will_ get out of those 4 weeks is just enough knowledge to realise exactly how far away mastery of the subject is, and more than likely kill any desire to try it again in the future.
