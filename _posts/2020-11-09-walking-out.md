If there's one thing I can definitely look back on with pride, it's that on the 8th May 2015 I walked out of my job. I deployed a ~~virus~~ script which changed all of the passwords on my (Linux-based) computer and deleted all of my personal and project data, and then I walked out of the building and never looked back.

I had that job for less than a year, and it had been my first out of university. I had struggled with it for a long time even before I quit, and had spent a lot of time looking for a new job while still gainfully employed. It was, in short, a nightmare.

I was employed by a bully, plain and simple. My boss -- let's call him Andy -- was a deeply unpleasant and narcisstic man, utterly convinced of his own greatness, and forever bemoaning the rest of the world for his lack of success. He was a man who pivoted from business idea to business idea, sticking with each one only long enough to acrue debts in the form of owed wages and bad assets.

This was a man whom I saw get into a fistfight over refusing to pay a contracter the agreed upon fee (he lost). A scrooge of a man who felt that paying minimum wage was too high, and that people shouldn't be allowed to take paid leave from work. A pustule of a man who actively sought out poor, eastern-European labourers because he could pay them illegally low amounts of money. A miser of a man who openly admitted to his plan to hire young men on apprentice wages for a cleaning job, and pull the fully paid job out from under them when they reached the end of their tenure.

As an employer he actively forgot to pay me on multiple occasions, once leaving me to chase him for my wage for three days before I was able to pay rent. I was required to go into the office after the two day break for Christmas, only to discover it locked up, and him not responsive to my phone calls. An hour later, it transpired that he had changed his mind, and he would see me in the new year. Or the time that he arrived at work still drunk from the "business meeting" from the night before.

This was not a man I enjoyed working for in any way, shape, or form. The job had been miss-sold as a technical position at a start up, where in fact it was a sales role, paid at the minimum wage with no commission. And what things we were selling! Andy in his wisdom had bought up the IT hardware from a failed government project related to the fire service, with a view to selling it to businesses for their own IT needs. A reasonable enough idea, if not for the fact that some of the (incredibly specialised) hardware was at least five years old at this time, and that Andy was convinced that these things were still worth the full, original retail price. First generation HP blade servers, Nortel networking equipment, and stacks upon stacks of car batteries (presumably intended for some kind of UPS solution).

Needless to say, that the original price these things were worth could have bought the whole job lot in one go. IT hardware ages quickly; most is out of date within a year, and out of support within ten. And yet I tried. I tried to find buyers, offer deals, and generally shift this crap. Every now and again I managed it, I got a sale. But it was never good enough. I was constantly berated for underselling the goods, for not getting enough for them. I was "giving it away" to use Andy's phrase.

After close to a year of this shit, I was very close to packing it in. I had been searching for graduate jobs from the first time he forgot to pay me, but hadn't been offered a role yet. All of the advice was (and continues to be): "don't quit a job until you have another lined up." Sensible advice, to be sure. "Don't just walk out," is some more advice that you'll see. It can ruin your prospects, by all accounts. After a year, I was close to ignoring all of that.

It was election day in 2015. I remember having a conversation with my parents that night, when I was seriously thinking about just not going back. It had been a very hard week. Andy had been ruder than usual, and was accusing me of trying to do him over and to give away all his equipment for free. It was cutting deep, and I was miserable. I was talking to my parents about it, and they advised me to stick it out if I could, and I was set on that course.

The exit poll results from the election came out, and the results began trickling in. A Conservative majority. At the time I wasn't terribly politically minded, but I kept an eye on things, and was rooting for a Labour win (although the Lib Dems got my vote). I went to bed late, drunk, and in a black mood. 

I arrived at work the next day to find it blissfully devoid of Andy. I thought I might be able to get through Friday without seeing him, and have the weekend to recharge my batteries a little. It was not to be, and an hour or so after I arrived, so did he. An innocuous comment from him about "giving his stuff away" prompted me to ask for a private conversation with him in his office. He obliged, and I tried to ask him to lay off a little. We spoke a little, and I ultimately said something to the effect of "I think you need to face the fact that this stuff isn't worth what you think it is." He told me that he didn't pay me to think, he paid me to do what I was told. And I snapped. I told him "fuck you, I'm done," and walked out. I paused only to nuke my computer, and then left without another word.

Why am I proud of this? Because you shouldn't stay in an abusive workplace, even when all the advice is to stick it out. I felt at the time like the world was telling me that I had to have a job, and to keep working, no matter how that work might make me feel. My mental health is worth more than a paycheck, and quitting in an ember of glory like that did wonders for me. I was fortunate that I was in a position to be supported by the people around me, and that I was able to find a new job not one month later. 

I don't regret for one second having that moment of realisation that I value myself enough to escape the nightmare. I can still feel the buzz I felt from that day, if I concentrate. That memory, and that feeling are surpassingly important to me, and drive me forwards. _I am worth more than this,_ I can tell myself. And I believe it, too.
