Well, with a title like that, it'd have to be exciting!  
This is a slightly belated post, as I've been busy all weekend... Or hungover.  

I had decided (with some coercion it has to be said) that it would be a good idea to get my hair cut... As some of you know, I had previously dreaded the cutting of my hair in Japanese, not least because I have no idea what sort of phrases would be needed... Something else I didn't anticipate was the idle chit-chat in the chair, but no matter!  

So in order to combat the mullet, I googled a few key phrases and managed to communicate what I wanted to the good man, who dutifully started cutting my hair. And I must say he did a great job! Despite the fact that he would occasionally press his crotch against my elbow...  

The cut was very thorough, he went at the back with clippers (something that hasn't happened in **years!**) and then preceded to use three different sets of scissors to trim the rest of my hair, and cutting what looked to be layers... This bodes well for future growth, as perhaps I may avoid the mullet-effect this time!  

When he had shown me the back of my head, I assumed that we were done... But no! First he went to a microwave and set it going... Then he took a vacuum that had been built into the unit in which all his tools were stored, and gave my head a good sucking - this was a little reminiscent of the suck-cut in Wayne's World, ho-ho! After this, he took a flannel from the microwave and gave my face - covered in hair as it was - a good wipe down. As a final hurrah, he took a (badger?) shaving brush, and covered the back of my neck and a little behind my ears in shaving foam, before taking a cut-throat razor (eek!) and tidying up all the edges. Efficient stuff, no?  

And all that for 1000 yen!   A bargain if ever I saw one.
