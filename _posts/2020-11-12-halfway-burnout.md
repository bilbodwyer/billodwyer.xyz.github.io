I had thought to write something along these lines closer to the halfway point of the month, but here we are. I'm tired, and I'm close to taking a day off.

These kinds of challenges are tricky. Sobriety and practising gratitude weren't as hard as this, because for the most part, they don't take conscious, active effort. You don't have to sit in front of a computer for an hour and expend energy to be sober. Earlier in the year I learned 30 songs in 30 days, and I felt a similar sense of tiredness around the halfway point.

On both occasions it's felt like more and more of an effort to get to grips with the task, because it's such an _active_ thing to do. I'm expending energy to write this, just as I was to learn those songs. And I'm running out of steam. But if the last challenge was anything to go by, this too will pass. Some days I needed an easy study, and I was able to learn a tune and film myself playing it within an hour. Other days I was compelled by the challenge of learning something harder, longer, and more outside my comfort zone.

So today is one of those easy study days. Initially when I sat down to write this, I felt less than great about it. _I should be able to write something long and great every day_, I thought. But in reminding myself that earlier in the year I needed something a bit easier or quicker to tick the box makes me feel less bad. The challenge is to write, after all. Not necessarily to write well.
