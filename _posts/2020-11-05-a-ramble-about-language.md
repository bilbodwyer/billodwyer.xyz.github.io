Contrary to what certain magical sitars may have you believe, the greatest thing you will ever learn is language. The developing human brain is exquisitely wired for language learning, taking these strange vibrations in the air and translating them into thoughts and meaning.

In a few short years we go from being barely able to communicate at all, to having the ability to articulate complex thoughts such as "she pushed me over in the playground, but I thought we were friends," or "I'm scared by the idea of what happens when we die." It is a remarkable tool that we seem uniquely adapted for acquiring and using, and indeed we seem hard-wired to _create_ language over the courses of our lives: the prevalence of pidgins and creoles (to say nothing of constructed languages!) throughout the world and history is evidence of that, I think.  

Whether or not the language we speak alters the ways we think has been the subject of much debate over the years. It might seem absurd to suggest that our perception of the world can be coloured by the language(s) that we speak: is not reality singular, and are we not all blessed with more-or-less the same senses with which to perceive it? A rose by any other name would smell as sweet, after all. 

What cardinal direction (north, south, east, west) are you, dear reader, facing right now? Some of you may be able to take a pretty good stab, but for the majority of people, knowledge of where we are in physical space is not important to know. For the [Kuuk Thaayorre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuuk_Thaayorre_language#Lexical_semantics) people of Northern Australia, cardinal directions are baked into their language. You would turn east, not left. Your cup might be to the north of mine. You have a south-south-eastern leg, depending on which way you're facing. In fact, saying hello in Kuuk Thaayorre transliterates as "which way are you going?" To get beyond a simple hello in conversation, the people of Kuuk Thaayorre must have an active awareness of their direction and location in space, and they are known to be superior navigators to English speakers.

In many ways, language can be extremely limiting. In English we have no word for the German term _schadenfreude_, (we just stole their word). Latin didn't have words for _yes_ or _no_, but answered with the relevant verb in the affirmative or negative. In Japanese it's far more common to answer in that same way than it is to hear the words _hai_ or _iie_. The Ancient Greeks had no word for blue, but they did have a multitude of words for love. Being able to properly articulate the difference between the love one feels for a partner and the love one feels for a parent seems like a very useful feature of the language to me. Having a shared arsenal of words with slightly different nuances can surely only aid in communication.
