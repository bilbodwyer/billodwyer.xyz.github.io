I have a dream of one day being on Desert Island Discs, the perennial BBC Radio 4 program where a guest (or 'castaway') is asked to select eight recordings a book and a luxury item that they would take if they were to be cast away on a desert island, whilst discussing their lives and the reasons for their choices. As radio goes, it's invariably an interesting listen, particularly if you are familiar with the castaway of the week.

Not to count my chickens, but I don't feel particularly on track to get onto the radio any time soon, so I thought I'd note down what my choices would be here, at the age of 28. Have a listen to each of them, I think there's some quite varied things in here!

### The Shire - Howard Shore  
Conjuring feelings of home, friendship, and a host of extraordinarily fond memories, the first slot has to go to the Lord of the Rings soundtrack. This particular track features at the start of the first film, and includes the full expression of the Shire theme, as well as a subdued Fellowship theme. Fellowship of the Ring is a very cosy watch for me. I remember seeing it in the cinema as a youth, and I've watched it at least once a year more or less since it came out. This track captures that cosiness the best in a single recording.

### Dream of Mirrors (Live at Rock in Rio) - Iron Maiden 
No list of this kind would be complete without an Iron Maiden track. Dream of Mirrors is already a masterpiece (and regrettably one that they no longer play live), and the live version from Rock in Rio is insanely good. I've seen Iron Maiden play live four times now, and each time they have blown me away. This particular track is a favourite to play with Ey Up Maiden (though we've not managed to perform it yet), and it strikes an excellent balance between the band's proggier impulses without meandering for too long. This is one of the rare songs that I don't mind playing with Ey Up Maiden where there's not a vast amount for me to do in terms of interesting playing.

### Trip To Bucharest/The Flight Of The Folk Mutants Parts 1 & 2 - Bellowhead
To say I was disappointed when Bellowhead announced they would be disbanding is an absurd understatement. By and large this is the band that got me into folk music. Their extremely playful arrangements of traditional tunes and songs, as well as their own compositions just resonated with me in a way that other attempts to get into the genre had failed to do. The overall dark tone of the whole recording, and the gradual build of the first tune into the bonkers melody of the Folk Mutants section combine to be the very definition of why I love Bellowhead so much.

### The Last Baron - Mastodon
The first time I heard this album I didn't really _get_ it. It had been listed as Metal Hammer's album of the year in 2009, and I made a point to give it a listen. The band's progressive sound and the slightly sludgy mix did not really mesh well with what I enjoyed at the time, but I kept returning to it over the following years, and oh boy am I glad I did. If I could choose this whole album, I certainly would, but alas I must choose just a single track. Clocking in at 13 minutes, it's an impressive closer to the album, and contains some absolutely mind-boggling riffs. In particular those at 5:30 and 8:43 have lodged themselves in my brain for all eternity.

### Linger Longer - Cosmo Sheldrake
I discovered Cosmo Sheldrake quite by accident, after going to see a Johnny Flynn and the Sussex Wit concert with my younger sister in 2013 or 2014 (the exact year escapes me). I was (somewhat snobbishly) less than impressed that we would be treated to an opening act whose only instrument seemed to be a Macbook and a couple of midi keyboards and pads. How wrong I was to doubt. Cosmo uses found sounds in nature to compose some of the most unusual music I've ever listened to. Beats created with the cracking of slate tiles, melodies generated using the vibrations of the sun, the twittering of birds, or the sounds that fish make all combine to make something other-worldly. This particular track is the opener from his first album, and it reminds me in some places of my own band [Sir Curse](https://sircurse.com). It's a slightly melancholy sounding track, but it's a joy to listen to at any time.

### Number 9 - Moon Hooch
Without exaggeration, Moon Hooch are probably the best live band I've encountered. A friend stumbled across a video of theirs on reddit, featuring a saxophone with a traffic cone stuck into the end, and I was immediately hooked. Number 9 is a straight up dance tune, and you cannot help but get down when that opening melody begins. The music feels like nothing short of the soundtrack to some kind of underground rave. In a live setting, the band barely pause for breath between tracks, so I've included a live version here to try to capture some of that level of excitement.

### Halo - Machine Head
Riffs. Riffs. Riffs. Machine Head are one of my all time favourite bands, and despite their recent decision to play 3 hour "Evenings with Machine Head" and forego having any supporting acts, they still hold a top spot among my best gig experiences. I discovered this track when I heard the band would be supporting at a Metallica concert I was due to attend. I snuck a listen during my shift at Sainsbury's, and even now the chorus riff of Halo brings me back to that moment. The musicality and ferocious playing of this song in particular have inspired my own playing and writing ever since.

### Talisk - Echo
Another folk band, this one a Scottish three piece featuring some of the most incredible playing I've ever witnessed. The frightfully quick concertina playing is beyond impressive, and this tune was stuck in my head from the very first listen. There is perhaps little else to say about this track, except that it transports me back (much like the Bellowhead number) to the days of the Cambridge Folk Festival, and fills me with that care-free sense of joy that only a festival can bring.

### Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell - Stephanie Clarke
If I'm only ever to read one book for the rest of my life (excepting the King James Bible and the entire works of Shakespeare), one of the first stipulations is that it would need to be a _tome_. Animal Farm, for example, is short enough that I fear I would be able to memorise it before too long on an island.  
My first thought of a long book is Lord of the Rings, and while that is certainly a strong contender, Stephanie Clarke's debut (and until this year, only) novel is the winner. It is an extremely witty tale of two English magicians during the early 19th century. Its style is somewhat ponderous and plodding, and it is written almost as a text-book, with footnotes containing citations from fictional works of magical history. The two main characters, Strange and Norrell, are polar opposites in their approaches to magic and yet are both highly compelling protagonists, as they quarrel not only with each other, but with Napoleon, the Duke of Wellington, an evil fairy, and the future of English magic itself. The depictions of magic are some of the most creative and imaginative I have come across in modern fantasy. An absolute joy to read, and to reread.

### An upright piano
My luxury item had to be something musical. I think I would lose my mind if I couldn't play music for the rest of my life, and I am not a competent enough craftsman to construct anything from the island's natural resources. I have a preference for uprights over grands that I can't quite explain. Grands do tend to sound better, but I find an upright to be the more beautiful object. Although I will concede that a grand piano would certainly be superior for use as a raft.
