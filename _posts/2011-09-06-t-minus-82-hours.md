In 82 hours, I'll be on the plane to Japan and in 109 hours, I will have arrived in Tokyo Narita, eagerly hunting for the "escort person holding a name board" to take me to my accommodation... Oh yes, bitches - Hosei is that good! (Though if this is Hosei-exclusive, I do not know.)

In the email explaining all of this to me, I also received a [google-map link.](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?hl=en&ie=UTF8&view=map&msa=0&msid=110361643537677050227.00046dc5acf87d67a7d93&z=9)  


I'm staying at Minamikasai... Which is a considerable distance from the Ichigaya campus where I'll be studying. Methinks a bicycle purchase may be in order!

And now some fun facts gleaned from my guide to Hosei accommodation:  

- "You must inform the dormitory manager if you wish to stay out by the morning of the day you will stay out." (curfue otherwise is 12 midnight...)
- "Illegal acts are strictly prohibited." (I should hope so!)
- "Gambling is forbidden." (Balls.)
- "Visitors of the opposite gender are not allowed in the dormitory." (Interesting...)

Finally, I'll leave you with my outrage that I will have to pay for the internet whilst staying in university accommodation at Hosei. ლ(ಠ益ಠლ
