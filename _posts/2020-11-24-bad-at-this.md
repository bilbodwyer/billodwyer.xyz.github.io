We're into the final week of NaBloWriMo and I am struggling. I feel like I need time to recharge my brain, to actually be able to think and cogitate about things before I write about them. I've barely had the time to edit some recent posts. I don't know what to write about, because even though I've got a few topics remaining in the tank, I was hoping to save them for when I felt energised enough to write properly.

Perhaps that's part of the lesson here: write even when you don't want to. Accept that it might not be perfect, and that I will probably [cringe]({% post_url 2020-06-30-cringing-lazarus %})} to read it back in the future. Just get it out into the world. 

With NaNoWriMo (the version of this challenge where you write a novel, not a series of blog posts), you at least have the benefit of not having to share your writing every day. Sure, you upload it to the NaNo website, but that's not a public forum. And while I am under no illusions as to the popularity of this blog (I'm glad to have not enabled tracking metrics!), there is something about putting these things out into the world that is mildly stressful. Knowing that my friends and family can (and do) read them is a pressure that I had forgotten about.

I don't want to censor myself, or to be dishonest. In some ways I am more honest on here than I am in person, because I can hide behind your phone/tablet/computer screen. But it's hard because I like to think I'm a good writer, and if I don't feel that I can write _well_ then I don't want to write. It's the same problem I have with writing music. If I can't write something _good_ I don't want to write at all.

But as countless artists, managers, labels, gurus, advisors, and people with a whole lot more experience than I do have said: you have to be prolific. You have to _just write_. You can't be afraid of being shit, because you will be shit. You need to get the bad stuff out of your system before you can get to the good quality material. That might take hundreds of songs, it might take thousands of blog posts. It could be a dozen attempts at writing a novel before you strike gold. The challenging part is just doing it.

Fear of being bad at something holds us all back at some point (I hope). But it's in the being bad that you learn to be less bad at a thing. I don't necessarily feel like my writing has improved over the last 24 days, but I do think that I am better for having made the attempt. I may not have improved, but I'm certainly no _worse_. And that is an encouraging thought.
