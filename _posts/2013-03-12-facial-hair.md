So my foray into the realm of growing facial hair has come to an end. Genetics have failed me and the sporadic growth that I didn't so much as trim for two months came to be about 2cm long and as scraggly as you like. It didn't look great.  
However, in the various Skypings (you know who you are!) I did whilst having this potential home to all kinds of unpleasant wildlife on my chin, the quality of the picture did make it look like I had a much more luscious beard. This led me to two potential solutions:  

1) Never shave my "beard" again, but also never leave the house and conduct all future social interactions via Skype.  
<span style="font-size: x-small;">Not actually a bad idea, I wouldn't have to venture out into the cold and I could continue lying to myself that the vegetation on my chin actually looked good.</span>  

2) Shave off my "beard" and carry on doing so until such time that I can cultivate a much grander specimen.  
<span style="font-size: x-small;">Probably the best option, since one of my New Year's Resolutions was to take more pride in my appearance...</span>  

So, congratulations to all who raised objection time and again to the vegetation on my face: you have succeeded once more in persuading me to shave it all off. Yes, I'm looking at you Elsie.  
Actually, in a sporadic fit of passion, I took the electric razor to it on Sunday night, so I can't actually provide photographic evidence of how terrible it actually was! Oh well!  

See you next time!

**<u>What I'm Listening To</u>**  
     [Do Me A Favor by Stone Sour](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OU-N6J8U6iE)  
I discovered Stone Sour properly just before they released their last album (A House of Gold and Bones Part 1). The album is just amazing. It's not for everyone, since the metal is strong with this one. Part 2 to the album is coming this April, and the song above is the first single. I only just found out that it's available, and I like it the more I listen to it. The metal is not so strong as the rock with this one, but it's still damned good! The only problem is that when watching the above video (that's a link up there if you didn't realise) I get really confused over the American spellings of most of the chorus... It's kind of annoying!  

**<u>What I've Been Watching</u>**  
     [Should You Eat Yourself by Vsauce](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdrTQlClb08)  
There'll be a blog coming soon with my favourite youtubers (thanks to [Siobh√°n](http://shivvie.blogspot.co.uk/) for the inspiration on that one!), and this guy is definitely one of them. Have a watch and learn some _amazingly_ cool stuff! Obviously there is the eponymous question of whether or not it's a good move to eat yourself, but there's also how your hair knows when to stop growing, what are those eye floaters and how much does wikipedia weigh? A really entertaining video that's only 7 minutes long, I urge you to watch! Just click the link above.  
No really, click it.  
Go on.  
Click it.  
It's right there.  
Do it now.  
Click it, come on!  

**<u>What I've Been Reading</u>**  
     [1Q84 by Haruki Murakami](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1Q84)  
Still reading this badboy, but I'm almost half-way through it now and it's starting to get really interesting... Another moon has just appeared in the sky and the two main characters' backstory is getting really fleshed out and the links between them are becoming more and more clear... Also something that I can really recommend that you buy!  

PS. If you enjoy my blog, please recommend it to a friend!  

PPS. If you don't enjoy my blog, but read them out of some masochistic self-punishment, recommend it to someone you don't like!  

And so, as the hair on my chin inexorably grows towards something not even remotely resembling an actual beard, and the clock on the wall ticks towards the inevitable doom of us all, I will end this blog.
