It's almost six years since I wrote a blog for publication on the Internet. I've written a lot of texts, emails, code, music, and even some prose in that time, but just recently I decided (for no reason other than egotism) that I wanted to return to long-form blogging.

In setting up a new blog, I figured that I'd best include the old archives and that meant importing my two former blogs (Diary of a Gaijin, and Rambling Blogger) into this one. That process was relatively straightforward, although it involved a little tweaking of formatting once imported (markup vs. markdown, am I right?). But, happy days, all of the posts from the latter three years at University are available for your reading pleasure once more!

Except it certainly wasn't a reading pleasure for me. Six years is a very long time, and in many ways the world today is a vastly different place. I was 22 years old when I last wrote a blog. 2014. Two years before all those celebrities died in seeming coordination. The year that manspreading became an officially recognised word. The year that Conchita Wurst won the Eurovision song contest. A time when Brexit wasn't remotely thinkable and Donald Trump's run at the White House seemed laughable.

I digress. In going through and tweaking the formatting of my older posts, I was reading little snippets of each, and more than snippets of others. I fancy myself a good writer, and I did at the time as well. But looking back on the pretention and semi-authoritative style I was writing with makes me now want to shrivel up and disappear. It's so horribly **cringe-worthy**. 

I was at the point of deciding to purge the writings from the Internet and start afresh, when it occurred that that surely isn't the way to respond to this feeling. We've all laid awake at night thinking back on and cringing to moments in our past. Everything from school days all the way up to the present gets dredged up by the brain somehow and somewhy. 

What value does that feeling of cringe serve, if not to flag to ourselves that _this is not how we do it?_ That shrivelling sensation makes you not want to act in that way again, makes you think _I must be better next time_. So it is with previous creative works. I look back on songs I once wrote thinking that I'd never top them, wondering how I could ever have thought they were even worth performing. Similarly I read my writings from 2011-2014 and wonder why on earth I thought anyone would want to read that drivel. To be honest I don't think many people will want to read _this_ drivel either, but the mere fact that I look back on those works of polished turdery and want to gnaw my own fists off surely is a sign of creative and personal growth?

I'm choosing to view it thus, as the alternative is either a purge of my Internet history (no, not that kind), or undergoing a small existential crisis. I promise you, dear reader, that this time I'll try to be better. I will write. I will _edit_. I will (hopefully) not let you down.
