So the homesickness finally hit a few weeks ago - manifesting itself in sleepless nights as well as minor loss of appetite (as if I can stand to lose any more weight!).  

As a result, there's likely to be no more posts on the family visit (sorry you lot!) - just because it wasn't helping matters. If I sort myself out in the future (undoubtedly I shall, when lessons begin again), I might do a quick summary of the week my family came to Tokyo.  

As it stands, I've not been really busy enough to warrant a blog post, but I might try to do a few more in the future, even if they're just short... Regularity is key, I'm certain!  
If I have any insights, I might do a few pseudo-educational posts, and some other stuff too - try to mix it up. I'm very consciously aware of my list of "to come" posts that have not materialised... I'll build up to it, I promise!  

I think I'll change the "ten reasons..." blog to a five reasons either way deal. I'd like to kid myself that I have a large enough readership to spark debate over it, but it doesn't seem likely ^_^ Any thoughts on ways to increase it?  

Erm, that's all for now!  

Ideas for posts:  
* The food for one week (will do this when meals are given to us again)  
* Five reasons why Japan>UK and five why UK>Japan  
* Taking the newbies to Hosei  
* Star Wars 3D
