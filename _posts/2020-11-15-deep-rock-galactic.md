And so from board games we arrive at video games, and the one I have been sinking the most hours into of late: Deep Rock Galactic. 

DRG is a co-operative first person shooter released earlier this year for PC and Xbox One. In it, you and up to three friends (or a set of strangers) control a group of four dwarves, hired by the company Deep Rock Galactic to mine a planet called Hoxxes IV. It's a perilous job, mostly because the native fauna does not want you there. Each mission will see you facing off waves of increasingly angry Glyphids, a spider-like swarm of mouths on legs.

In order to succeed in your mission, you and your companions must work together to complete objectives to take home some booty, and ultimately get paid. You might be recovering lost mining equipment, collecting a particular mineral, or guiding a large, autonomous drill to the centre of a giant cave system. The missions vary in length, complexity, and difficulty, but teamwork is the key to victory.

There are four classes of dwarf in Deep Rock Galactic: Scout, Driller, Engineer, and Gunner. The Gunner is the most familiar-feeling character type for a first person shooter: you have a machine gun, a pistol, and grenades. You also have a set of ziplines that you can set up to traverse the map more easily. As the Driller, you have a portable drilling machine that you can use to quickly dig tunnels and pathways around the map, as well as a flamethrower for controlling crowds of Glyphid enemies. The Scout possesses a flare gun, used to light large caverns for the rest of the team to see what they need to do, and also a zipline, for quick traversal around the map. And the Engineer's job is to set up sentry turrets and deploy miniature platforms for the rest of the team to use to get to hard-to-reach veins of gold, and other minerals. 

Each class has its strengths and vulnerabilities, and while it is possible to complete missions solo (with the help of a computer-controlled drone known as BOSCO), the harder difficulties are much further out of reach without a squad to go down the mine with. The game is built with co-operative play in mind, and in my experience it's just not as fun without a good crew to play with.

Which brings me to the multiplayer aspect. You can host games of Deep Rock Galactic and bring strangers into your crew to work together to tackle the harder missions (which invariably contain the richest veins of rare minerals, and have the best rewards). In the past I have struggled with co-operative games such as Overwatch because I haven't been able to communicate with my teammates very effectively, and being a team vs. team game, Overwatch (and others like it) can lead to some incredibly negative people joining the game and mouthing off in the chat.

Not so, Deep Rock Galactic! I have had some of the most positive multiplayer experiences of my gaming life playing this game. Most people aren't on the voice chat, but that doesn't matter because of two things: first, every class knows its particular role, and players pick their class according to the roll they want to take on for each game. And second, the game offers two quick ways of communicating. A pointing tool, and the 'v' button on the keyboard. The pointing tool will dynamically highlight what you're looking at and mark it out for other players. For instance, as the Scout I might see a vein of gold that's high up and impossible to get to. Tagging it alerts the Engineer to its position, and they shoot up a platform for me to stand on while I dig. It's a very elegant system.

And the 'v' button is how to make your dwarf character vocalise. Tapping the key causes your dwarf to raise his pickaxe in the air and cry out "ROCK AND STONE!", a cry which is normally met by the rest of your team also mashing their v keys. Missions end back in the drop pod with all the players together hammering v to show their satisfaction with another job well done.

Add in the fact that the game does such a wonderful job of cultivating a "workers vs management" type atmosphere, and you have a recipe for excellent player interactions almost every time. Everyone is just here to do the job, dig a hole, mine resources, and moan about how poor management, and the company as a whole is. Presumably, it's run by elves.

Missions in Deep Rock Galactic feel tense and stressful, and there are genuine moments of panic, but above all they are straight up _fun_. A horde of insectoid monsters crawling out of the cave ceiling towards you, a sea of gaping jaws scuttling along the ground, and a teammate suddenly cries out "OPPRESSOR!" as a gigantic, armour-plated, acid-spitting _thing_ appears out of nowhere. The odds can seem overwhelming, and yet it never feels punishing. As a wave peters out and your squad call down a supply pod to reload and heal up, relief floods through you as you realise you can get back to your task of harvesting liquid morkite. The end of each mission is a countdown to get to the escape pod, and as you run more and more Glyphid enemies spawn in to chase you off. You flee for your life, and you grin as you do it, because there's something so very Starship Troopers about the whole affair (indeed, you occasionally hear a dwarf yell out "I'm doing my part"). 

I have rarely played a game that makes me feel so badass, particularly from the first person perspective. In a recent game I was able to throw an ice grenade at a cluster of enemies, zip over their heads with my grappling hook, chip some healing crystals out of the wall, and then pepper the frozen enemies from behind with my rifle, all in one swift movement. It made me feel genuinely awesome! 

Deep Rock Galactic is (unexpectedly) one of the defining parts of my 2020. Whole evenings have been whiled away digging holes with my friends, talking over voice chat, and meeting for a drink at the in-game bar to discuss the mission, or how work was that week, or the latest episodes of the Mandalorian. Rousing choruses of [Diggy Diggy Hole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytWz0qVvBZ0) echo through my house as my colleagues muster up a crew to head down into the pits. Multi-hour sessions spent designing our characters on the [Hero Forge](https://heroforge.com) tool. It's a game that has seeped outside of my PC and into my real life, and I don't even feel close to done with it. I can't wait to see what else the mines of Hoxxes have in store for me.

Rock and stone.
