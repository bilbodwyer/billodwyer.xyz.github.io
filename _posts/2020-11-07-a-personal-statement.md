Today, something a little different. I am applying to do a Master's degree in Linguistics and Second Language education at the University of Leeds, and I thought for posterity I might keep my personal statement written here. My statement for applying to my Bachelor's course is long since lost, and I do regret not being able to look back on it. I hope as well that if successful in my application, that this personal statement might serve as a useful example (but not a template!) for those looking to make their own applications to Masters courses in the future. 

As I'm sure you're aware, it is a deeply personal thing to write in such a way to sell yourself, as in a job or university application. It's something that many -- myself included -- struggle with, so a further hope is that making this public will help me overcome that powerful urge to be modest and undersell myself. Sometimes, it's nice to remind myself that I am pretty awesome.

> I graduated from Leeds University with a 2:i degree in Japanese in July 2014. My love for languages and linguistics extends back many years, and one of the things which drew me to learning Japanese was its radical differences from the Romance and Germanic languages I already had familiarity with, and the new perspectives that difference could bring. During my year studying at Hosei University in Tokyo I took an elective module in applied linguistics, and became passionate about the subject. I gained a broad understanding of several linguistic topics from a comparative perspective, including language acquisition, pidgins and creoles, and multilingualism. For the final project of the course, I constructed a new language and alphabet for which I received a top mark.

> Since that time I have continued my interest in linguistics and language, including studying several languages such as Chinese and French, and learning about constructed languages such as Toki Pona and Dothraki. I recently read Gretchen McCulloch’s Because Internet, and have just started to read Steven Pinker’s The Language Instinct, as well as being a continued listener of the linguistically focused podcast The Allusionist. In McCulloch’s book I was particularly interested to learn how different groups in high schools use quirks of language to differentiate themselves from other cliques, and how the period during which groups of people “came online” today affects their use of language both on- and offline. These were both fascinating examples of how language both shapes and is shaped by the people with whom we communicate. 

> Since my graduation I have worked in IT support, which has been a fascinating challenge. Through it I have developed my skills in logical and critical thinking, problem solving, and statistical analysis. The busy nature of an IT helpdesk has taught me to properly manage my time and workload, to prioritise tasks, and to communicate with people of various ages and levels of IT literacy, tailoring my explanations to their level of interest and understanding.

> I have been considering a change in career, and aspire to teach English to adults and migrants to the UK. During my year abroad I worked as an English tutor, and I was an active participant in language exchange programs both at Hosei University and the Japanese Society at Leeds, helping others to practise their English speaking (and taking the opportunity to practice my Japanese). I found teaching to be a highly rewarding job, and I look forward to building new skills in language teaching, particularly from a linguistic perspective. 

> I am applying to Leeds in part because I am a graduate of the university, but also because of the course’s unique focus on language education and the experience of the tutors in researching this topic. As a student of several languages I am particularly interested in the Second Language Acquisition module, and as an aspiring educator, the Language Teaching Methodology and Practice modules have both captured my excitement as well. 

> During my undergraduate study, I enjoyed the research and writing process of essay-based subjects, in particular my dissertation. I continue to enjoy researching and writing shorter form blog posts to this day. Additionally, a Japanese language degree necessarily involves a large amount of independent work; practising speaking outside of lessons, and the regular study of kanji. Also as a self-taught musician and programmer I have a proven track record of my discipline in independent study and my dedication to self improvement. 

> If successful in achieving this Master's degree, my plan is to spend time teaching English both abroad and in the UK. I aim to return to Japan via the JET program and teach English in schools, and then to take that experience home to the UK, and to teach the language to asylum seekers and refugees seeking to build a new life. I am excited to be taking this first step towards this journey.
