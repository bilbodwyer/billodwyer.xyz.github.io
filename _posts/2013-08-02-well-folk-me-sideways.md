Good golly gosh!  

I've never been to a music festival before, but I finally made it to one this year. They say that you always remember your first time and phwoar! Cambridge Folk Festival 2013, what a way to take my festival virginity. Plenty of alcohol was consumed (to the point where the festival was drunk completely dry of cider) and lots of antics were had.  

Particularly brilliant moments included befriending some Norwegians at 2am on Saturday morning, before wandering off to find a session happening (which my big bro was taking part in); a young magician about the age of nine wandering the crowds and wowing us with some pretty swish tricks and patter; crouched handstands; and a midnight kebab.  

Musical highlights were:

Bellowhead were the band I was most excited to see for the entire weekend; and they definitely did not disappoint! (Well, maybe a little... They didn't play my favourite song)

Undoubtedly the group favourite for the weekend: Four Irish fellas playing some amazing tunes with banjos, mandolins, a bodhran and a fiddle at points too... Saw them twice!

Utterly astounding guitarist, best player I've ever seen bar none. Being just one fellow and a guitar, his set was a little avant-guarde at points but folking hell was it good! An inspiration to listen to.

Where to begin? My uncle found us whilst this lot were playing and wandered past saying "I've just seen a young Seasick Steve!" I found myself on my way to see them, unsure what to expect but was totally blown away. The amount of sound coming off these three people was insane! And as the bearded wonder was keen to mention: they had no need of a bass player: all of the bass was played on the guitar at the same time. Incrediballs. (Incidentally, see 0:37 for the afore-mentioned handstands)

A folk quartet from Quebec, they were infectious to listen to. The foot-stomping violinist was awesome and you never see a hurdy-gurdy solo these days...  

The amazingness of the weekend can be summed up by the fact that I was ready to commit to Cambridge 2014 within four hours of having arrived.  

Result.  

My aim for next year: become proficient enough at the guitar and whistle (and probably some other stuff too) to be able to find a session and just go nuts.
