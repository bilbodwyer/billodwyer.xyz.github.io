If you have no idea what my new year's resolutions are, and find yourself even having a modicum of care, go peruse my post about that, which can be found [here](http://localhost:4000/2013/01/03/resolutions.html).  

So we're into March now, and I'm failing at most of my resolutions with the exception of the press-ups and Maia's lullaby...  
I'm up to 66 press-ups per day, and it's get kind of gruelling, so I think I'm going to have to separate them out into clumps of thirty-something over the course of the day maybe. I'm quite keen to keep this one up, because it's giving me muscle definition that I've never experienced before!  
Maia's lullaby is going fairly well, I've transcribed it into a bit of music-writing software so that I can tweak it more easily without a piano... It doesn't sound great played as MIDI, but it's a step up from just humming it to myself and trying to guess the right notes!  

Let's see... Pride in my appearance is failing dramatically. I need a haircut, should probably shave this hideous growth on my chin into oblivion and I think I have spent more days unshowered than showered so far this year. I'll make more effort, oh gods of resolutions: I promise!  
Practising Japanese is also going nowhere fast, despite my thinking to myself several times a day that I really ought to get some kind of system into place. So, in the interest of having a plan and sticking to it, I'm going to tell the Internet at large (not that large, the most views any one of my posts has received is about 50) that come the easter break (that's in about 12 days' time) I am going knuckle down, get myself a system together and _stick to it_. As the Internet, you have permission to punish me for not sticking to this promise.  
Skills and hobbies... Well, I _did_ sign up to a gym last week, but since then I haven't been back (planning to go this evening though). Also, I've found that playing Halo 4 online with a group of friends is considerably less depressing than playing it alone. Neither of these are really something interesting though, so I'll keep trying, shall I?  

That's it, I'm signing off.  
I'm not going to do a "What I've Been _______" this time, because this was just meant to be a quick update, and there's many more blogs in the pipeline!  

Incidentally, I can recommend using an RSS reader so you can subscribe to all of your favourite blogs, and mine. I use google reader, and it's really quite useful - all of the posts of the blogs I read are collected into one place. If you do decide to use google reader, don't use the web-app as it's awful to use. Instead, use the android app as it's _so_ much nicer!  

Ciao for now.
